I have recently written [an introduction](https://binarapps.com/blog/browser-automation-with-watir-guide)
to Watir for testers who have hardly any experience with test automation.

<!--more-->

The post covers everything necessary to get started - 
including both fundamentals (the testing pyramid and choosing the right test cases for automation)
and technical details - Watir setup and most important methods.

I hope it will be helpful in introducing people to an awesome tool that Watir really is.
