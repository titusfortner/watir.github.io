Watir 6.11.0 is now available on RubyGems. This is the production version of the
 performance release you've been promised.
<!--more-->

***To install:***

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install watir
{% endhighlight %}

***or in your Gemfile:*** 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "watir", "~> 6.11"
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>

### Performance!

See our [previous post](/watir-6-11-beta1/) about the intention of this release. While 6.11
decreases the number of wire calls made in our watirspecs by over 40%, we haven't had any
reports of significant real-world performance improvements. This will have the biggest
impact on those who are running remotely with high latency network connections, 
and for those who use complicated locator strategies. 
Everyone else should see some minor speed improvements.
Let us know if you find any bugs that we didn't catch with our beta releases, and 
definitely let us know if you see some solid real-world performance improvements with this.

Regardless, this update has done a lot to simplify our code as we move toward Watir 7.0.

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/watir/watir/blob/master/CHANGES.md) 
for the complete history of updates.
