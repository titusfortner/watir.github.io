Anukul Singhal from Infogain has recently requested to add the company he is working for to our Watir Users list.

<blockquote>Hi,

I work at Infogain and would like to include our company’s logo on the Watir page.

We have been using Watir extensively for the past 4 years and built a data driven framework on it. Also, for cross browser support (firefox, chrome), we have incorporated watir-webdriver gem, and also using this in conjunction with the cucumber framework.

This has been working wonders for us, and we run a suite of about 350 testcases on a daily basis.

Please let me know if you can include our company’s logo, and any specific information that you might require.

Thanks,
Anukul Singhal</blockquote>

If you would like to add your company to the list send us a logo (150×51), link to the home page and (if possible) a link to the page that says you are using Watir. The Watir Users list is at the bottom of our <a href="http://watir.com/">home page</a> (above comments).
