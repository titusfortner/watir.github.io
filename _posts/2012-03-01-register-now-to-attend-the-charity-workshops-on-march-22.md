<h1><strong>Workshop Topics</strong></h1>
<strong>Page Objects and Cucumber</strong>

1:00 PM - 5:00 PM

Are you already familiar with test automation, but want to take your framework to the next level?  Are you interested in learning how to implement Cucumber?  Then join Jeff Morgan (aka Cheezy) and Jari Bakken to learn about Page Objects and Cucumber.

To sign up for the workshop, enter your name and email address and which workshop you're attending and then select a charity to make a $50 donation.  Space is limited to 25 people, so sign up soon to reserve your spot!

Follow up:  The workshop was a great success!  Cheezy did a great job teaching us about Page Objects and we raised $750 for local charities.  We're considering putting the video up for an optional donation - more to come on that.
