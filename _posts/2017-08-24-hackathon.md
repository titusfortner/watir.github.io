and project lead for [Watir](http://watir.com)

Ruby is an excellent language in which to write automated browser tests. It is easy to read, fun to use, and has dozens of different gems that do all kinds of different things that make it easier to write and maintain test suites at all levels of complexity. We'd like to improve how some of these gems work together and be able to provide a packaged collection of code that makes it easier for people to ramp up their automated test suites from scratch.
I've been calling this idea the "Rails of Automated Testing." In the same way that Rails made it easy and fun for people without much domain experience to create a web application, there is a more specialized need to provide a solution like this for people tasked with writing automated tests.

This might not be a typical hackathon, but we will be deciding on objectives and splitting up into groups to dig into code to make it happen. Project owners will be on hand to answer questions or provide deep dives into the code bases. Options for exploration will include things like: test data management, session configuration, mobile APIs, page modeling and project scaffolding.

Please bring your testing experience and/or your coding skills and join us in Toronto.
