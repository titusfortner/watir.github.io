Yes, the website looks a little different! We got some professional help to tidy things up and add a few new features.

<!--more-->

Welcome to the new and improved design (and a much more organized code base for the site). 

* You can search the site from the search bar in the top right hand of the header
* On the watir news page, you can locate old articles by Date or by Tag
* New Sidebar with links to additional resources
* Everything else is cosmetic

Please let us know if you see anything on our site that doesn't look right after the updates.
