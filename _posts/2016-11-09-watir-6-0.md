for a complete list of updates.

Since Watir 6.0 Beta 5 there have been two significant additions.

# Automatic Waits
A more thorough explanation surrounding the reasons for this change can
be found on this 
[Watirtight Testing post](http://watirtight.com/2016/10/13/wait-in-the-watir.html).

This feature helps synchronize test code with the website by making
additional effort to type the things and click the things written in
the tests. If your test times have increased significantly, take a look at
[the Watir 6 FAQ](/watir-6-faq/#H).

# Updated Wait methods

`#when_present` is gone, and `#wait_until` and `#wait_while` have gotten
more powerful. 

You shouldn't need `#when_present`, but if you do, you can use the new
implementation of `#wait_until_present`, which returns the object
being waited for to allow for use in chaining.

Here are some examples of the ways that the new `#wait_until` and
`#wait_while` methods can be used:

{% highlight ruby %}
element.wait_until(&:present?).text
element.wait_until(timeout: 5, &:present?).text
element.wait_until(message: “Sorry”, &:present?)
element.wait_while { |el| el.text == ‘Foo’ }
element.wait_while { browser.title == ‘Foo’ }
{% endhighlight %}
