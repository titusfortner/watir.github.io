Watir 6.1 is now available on RubyGems! In addition to Ruby 2.4 support
we've added a couple new features and bug fixes.
<!--more-->

***To install:***

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install watir
{% endhighlight %}

***or in your Gemfile:*** 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "watir", "~> 6.1"
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>

### Polling Intervals for Waits

With the switch to keywords we can add new ones where needed. The polling
interval is the length of time between retrying the command in the wait block.
Up until now it has been hard coded at 0.1 seconds. If you are waiting for something
that is going to take longer than a second, it could make sense to increase
this value to reduce the unnecessary pinging of your server, etc.

Use the keyword parameter just like you would for `timeout` and `message`:
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.div(id: 'first').wait_until(interval: 0.5, &:present?)
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>

### Visible Locator for Collections

Watir 6.0 introduced the `visible` locator to find the first matching element
that is or is not hidden. You can now get a collection of all elements that are
hidden or visible.

For example:
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.divs(class: 'shy', visible: true)
{% endhighlight %}
