Welcome to the new Watir website! Content from [watir.com](http://watir.com) and 
[watirwebdriver.com](http://watirwebdriver.com) has been merged, and both 
domains will soon be redirected here.

 The Watir Team has recommended moving to the WebDriver (Selenium) backed 
 implementation of Watir for several years now, and it is finally time to stop 
 making a distinction when we refer to this project. The original 
 IE-only implementation (which has been referred to as Watir Classic) 
 is being deprecated and should no longer be used for production test suites. 
 Going forward, the supported Watir code is powered by Selenium. 
  
Selenium is the future of browser automation, and any project that relies on 
that functionality needs to be taking advantage of it. All of the major 
browser vendors (Mozilla, Google, Microsoft and Apple) now have their own 
webdriver implementations, and are collaborating on an official 
[w3c specification](http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html) for 
browser automation.

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
The code for generating this site is
[available on github](https://github.com/watir/watir.github.io). We'd love to
get help or suggestions for making the site better. Please feel free to
[suggest code](https://github.com/watir/watir.github.io/pulls) or
 [recommend changes](https://github.com/watir/watir.github.io/issues).
