<a href="http://home.e-tjenesten.org/~ato/">Andreas Tolf Tolfsen</a> (of <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operawatir/">OperaWatir</a> fame) suggested that we add <a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> donations to our web site.

From their <a href="https://flattr.com/about">about</a> page:

<blockquote>Flattr is the worlds first social micro-payment system.</blockquote>

In short, you create an account, add to your account at least 2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro">euros</a> each month (about 2.80 usd at the moment), and select one or more <em>things</em> (official term). Your 2 euros (or more, if you like) will split among the <em>things</em> you have <em>flattered</em> (again, official term).

Flattr is used by <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/42724/NoScript">NoScript</a>, <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/29919/Debian-Package-Manager-dpkg">Debian Package Manager â€” dpkg</a>, <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/65556/W3C-Validator">W3C Validator</a>, <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/56976/phpMyAdmin">phpMyAdmin</a>, <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/85825/GNU-wget">GNU wget</a>...

You will find our <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/141470/Watir">Flattr</a> donation button just above our <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/2982">Pledgie</a> donation button at the sidebar.

At the moment we have 2 <em>flattrs</em> (not sure if this is official term). We have to pay 2 euros each month to keep our account alive, so we hope we will get at least that much.

I promise we will not spend all of the money on beer. :)
