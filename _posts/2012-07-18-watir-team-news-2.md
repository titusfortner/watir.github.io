A couple of weeks ago I have been added to <a href="http://watir.com/team/">Watir team</a>. My name is <a title="Alex Rodionov" href="https://twitter.com/p0deje" target="_blank">Alex Rodionov</a> and I am a software tester with 2 years experience in building test automation for web applications in Ruby.

As I was using Watir-WebDriver more and more, I was thinking about the ways I can improve it, so my activity on <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/p0deje" target="_blank">Github</a> has finally brought me here.

I'm proud to be a part of Watir team and the first member from Russia. As you could guess, my primary focus is Watir-WebDriver and WatirSpec, so look forward to improvements there from my side.

Tiffany Fodor used to be support sheriff, but she did not have the time to contribute lately, so we have moved her to alumni <a href="http://watir.com/2011/10/25/watir-team-news/">last year</a>. Since she helped a lot with organizing <a href="http://watir.com/test-automation-bazaar/">Test Automation Bazaar</a> conference this year, she is back to the team, but instead of support sheriff, she is now conference organizer.
