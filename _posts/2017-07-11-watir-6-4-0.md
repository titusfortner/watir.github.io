### Performance, Performance, Performance

There are no new features in this release, just an overhaul to how Watir handles 
Selenium wire calls. You can read more in the previous article on the 
[release candidate](/watir-6-4-rc1). We'd [love to hear](https://twitter.com/watir_team) 
how much this speeds up your tests, and as always, 
[let us know if you find bugs](https://github.com/watir/watir/issues)
<br/>

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/watir/watir/blob/master/CHANGES.md) 
for the complete history of updates.
