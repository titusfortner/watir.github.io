<!--- TODO: Need to list the various options for this & discuss overall theory --->

The Page Object pattern is a way to represent pages and their elements in reusable classes. 
The Watir wiki has a [thorough explanation](https://github.com/watir/watir/wiki/Page-Objects) 
of the concept.

There are several gems that help you implement page objects:

* [Watir Page Helper](http://watirmelon.com/2011/05/05/introducing-the-watir-page-helper-gem/)
* [LoadableComponent](http://github.com/jarib/loadable_component)
